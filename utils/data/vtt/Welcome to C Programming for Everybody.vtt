00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.110
Welcome to C programming
for everybody.

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.400
My name is Charles Severance and

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.280
I'm your instructor
for this course.

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.640
This course and website
is dedicated to

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.040
learning the classic version
of C programming language

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.000
from the 1978 book

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.240
written by Brian W. Rigan
and Dennis M. Ritchie.

8
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.120
This book places the reader in

9
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.580
the middle of the
1970s transition from

10
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.880
a hardware centered
computer science to

11
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.040
a focus on writing portable
and efficient software.

12
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.700
C was used to develop

13
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.840
operating systems like
Unix, Minix, and Linux.

14
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.620
Programming languages
like Perl, Python,

15
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.060
Java and Javascript
and ruby are all

16
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.080
written in C. Software
like early TCPIP

17
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.500
networking stack implementations
that made the Internet

18
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.920
possible were written in
C. The first web browsers

19
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.470
and web servers were
written in C. Writing

20
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.000
software and C enabled

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.020
major advances in computer
architecture and performance.

22
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.940
Operating systems, compilers and

23
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.900
utilities could be
recompiled to work on

24
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.800
a new hardware platform once we

25
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.370
had a C compiler for
the new hardware.

26
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.660
Much software has been
written in C over

27
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.960
the past 40 years that there's
a very good chance that

28
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.520
much of the software
that you use

29
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.080
every day was either
written in C or written in

30
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.160
a programming language
that was written in

31
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.820
C. We study C less as

32
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240
a programming language to
use on a daily basis and

33
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.480
more as the foundation of
modern software and computing.

34
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.920
In many ways, C
is the technology

35
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.120
equivalent of the
Rosetta Stone in that it

36
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.580
provides a connection between
the programming languages

37
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.780
of the past and the programming
languages of the present.

38
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.270
The name CC4E and

39
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.785
www.cc4e.com refers to the
original Unix command CC,

40
00:01:44.785 --> 00:01:46.280
which was the command that

41
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.345
you used to compile
your C program.

42
00:01:48.345 --> 00:01:52.000
CC stood for C compiler
and it is featured

43
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.800
on the first page of the first
chapter of the KNRC book.

44
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.240
Programmers like me from
the 1970s and 1980s

45
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.820
Tite CC on Unix systems
like the ATNT3B2 to

46
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.900
compile and run their
first Hello World program

47
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.500
in C. This material is being

48
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.800
presented under fair use

49
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.360
as we are making use
of material from

50
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.080
a copyrighted work
that is out of print

51
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.220
and not broadly
available in any format.

52
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.320
The book is also not available
in any accessible format.

53
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.080
We are making use
of this material

54
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.700
in a teaching and
research context

55
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.020
with a focus on studying

56
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.585
its contribution to
computing history.

57
00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.690
The materials available for free

58
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.710
and online to anyone who
wants to learn about

59
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.970
the history of the C
language computing and

60
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.950
computer architecture.
Welcome to the course.
